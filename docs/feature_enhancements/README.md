# Legacy path compatibility

These files are kept temporarily to reduce merge conflicts with branches/PRs that still reference
`docs/feature_enhancements/*`.

Canonical locations are:
- `docs/All_Setups_Computation_Transparency.md`
- `docs/SCHEMA_CHANGES.md`
- `docs/feature_improvements/improvements_existing_data.md`

After open PRs are merged/rebased, this folder can be removed again.
