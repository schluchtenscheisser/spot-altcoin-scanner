# Feature Improvements (temporary work instructions)

This folder is intentionally temporary.

It should contain only active work-instruction documents for:
- concrete feature overhauls
- concrete new feature implementation plans

Workflow rule:
1. Put actionable instruction docs here while work is pending.
2. After implementation, move fulfilled instruction docs to `docs/archive/`.
3. Keep permanent reference/spec docs in `docs/` (root), not here.
